"""End-to-end integration tests for the complete scraping workflow.

This module provides comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete
scraping workflow from UI interactions through background tasks to data persistence.
These tests focus on real user scenarios and ensure the system works correctly
end-to-end without mocking internal components.

Key scenarios tested:
- Happy path: Start scraping → Monitor progress → Complete successfully
- Stop mid-scrape: Start → Stop partway → Verify cleanup
- Reset after complete: Complete scrape → Reset → Verify clean state
- Error recovery: Scraping fails → Error displayed → Can retry
- Proxy integration: Scraping with proxies enabled/disabled
- Real-time updates: Progress updates correctly during scraping

"""Database Transaction and Rollback Integration Tests.

This test suite validates database transaction handling, rollback mechanisms,
and data consistency across various failure scenarios. Tests ensure proper
ACID compliance and recovery from transaction failures.

Test coverage includes:
- Transaction rollback on service failures
- Concurrent transaction isolation
- Bulk operation transaction boundaries
- Nested transaction handling
- Deadlock detection and resolution
- Data consistency after rollbacks
- Connection pool behavior during failures
- Recovery from database corruption scenarios

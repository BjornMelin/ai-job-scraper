## CRITICAL: Immediate Remediation Required

### üîß HIGH PRIORITY: Documentation Language Fixes (Required)

**Issue**: 5 subjective terms violate documentation quality standards

**Files Requiring Updates**:

1. **`/home/bjorn/repos/ai-job-scraper/src/scraping/job_scraper.py`**

   ```bash
   # Line 3: Replace "simple" with "library-first"
   # Line 4: Replace "seamless" with "direct" 
   # Line 30: Replace "simple" with "async/sync"
   ```

2. **`/home/bjorn/repos/ai-job-scraper/src/services/job_service.py`**

   ```bash
   # Line 7: Replace "Simple" with "Streamlit"
   # Lines 203,447: Replace "simple" with "Streamlit-based"
   ```

**Remediation Commands**:

```bash
# Fix job_scraper.py subjective terms
sed -i 's/This module provides a simple,/This module provides a library-first,/' src/scraping/job_scraper.py
sed -i 's/with seamless integration/with direct integration/' src/scraping/job_scraper.py  
sed -i 's/Provides simple async/Provides async/' src/scraping/job_scraper.py

# Fix job_service.py subjective terms
sed -i 's/Simple caching using/Streamlit caching using/' src/services/job_service.py
sed -i 's/Uses simple Streamlit/Uses Streamlit-based/' src/services/job_service.py

# Validate fixes
rg '\b(simple|easily|seamless|powerful|revolutionary|fast|best[- ]in[- ]class|state[- ]of[- ]the[- ]art)\b' src/
```

**Expected Time**: 15-30 minutes  
**Priority**: HIGH - Must be completed before production deployment

### üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY: Import Warning Resolution (Optional)

**Issue**: Analytics service import warning (non-critical)

**Investigation Required**:

```bash
# Check analytics service status
grep -r "analytics_service" src/services/__init__.py
# Verify if analytics functionality is currently needed
```

**Action**: Monitor - does not block JobSpy functionality

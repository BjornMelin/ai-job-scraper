# Future Production Reference Archive

This directory contains ADRs that were originally designed for production-scale infrastructure but are over-engineered for the current local development scope.

## Archived ADRs

These ADRs represent valid architectural patterns but require enterprise-level infrastructure:

### ADR-042: vLLM Two-Tier Deployment Strategy (ARCHIVED)

- **Original Focus**: Production-scale vLLM deployment with 2-tier architecture
- **Why Archived**: Requires complex resource management, host system monitoring, enterprise alerting
- **Local Alternative**: Simple local vLLM service or API fallback (see replacement ADR-042)

### ADR-043: Host System Resource Management (ARCHIVED)

- **Original Focus**: Production host resource monitoring with PCIe bandwidth tracking
- **Why Archived**: Requires enterprise monitoring stack, complex resource allocation
- **Local Alternative**: Basic Docker resource limits (see replacement ADR-043)

### ADR-044: Production Monitoring and Alerting Strategy (ARCHIVED)

- **Original Focus**: Comprehensive production monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- **Why Archived**: Over-engineered monitoring infrastructure for local development
- **Local Alternative**: Simple logging and basic health checks

### ADR-045: Cost Optimization and Resource Efficiency (ARCHIVED)

- **Original Focus**: $30/month budget optimization with 98% local processing
- **Why Archived**: Complex cost tracking and optimization not needed for local dev
- **Local Alternative**: Simple resource allocation for development

## When to Reference These ADRs

These ADRs may be valuable for future production deployment:

- **Scaling Beyond Local Development**: When moving from local development to production
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced patterns for production-scale optimization
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Understanding complex deployment requirements
- **Cost Management**: Production-level cost optimization strategies

## Current Local Development Focus

The active ADRs now focus on:

- Simple Docker containerization for local development
- Basic environment configuration and setup
- Local SQLite database usage
- Reflex framework for UI development
- Simple async patterns for background processing
- Development velocity over production optimization

## Migration Path

If production deployment becomes necessary:

1. Review archived ADRs for production patterns
2. Adapt complex patterns to current infrastructure requirements
3. Implement monitoring and alerting appropriate to scale
4. Consider cost optimization strategies from archived ADR-045

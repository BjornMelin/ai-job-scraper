## Architectural Evolution Summary

### Key Transformations

| Domain | Original Approach | Current Approach | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **AI/LLM** | Cloud-primary (OpenAI + Groq) | Local-first (vLLM + Qwen3) | 95% cost reduction |
| **Database** | Basic SQLite + custom patterns | Hybrid SQLModel + Polars + DuckDB | 3-80x performance |
| **Scraping** | Multi-library complexity | Crawl4AI primary + JobSpy fallback | 75% code reduction |
| **UI Framework** | Streamlit with limitations | Reflex with WebSocket real-time | Full responsiveness |
| **Background Processing** | Custom async patterns | RQ/Redis with specialized queues | 3-5x throughput |
| **Error Handling** | Complex custom classes | Library-first with Tenacity | Simplified maintenance |

### Success Metrics Achieved

- **89% Code Reduction:** 2,470 ‚Üí 260 lines through library-first approach
- **98% Local Processing:** 8000 token threshold optimization  
- **95% Cost Reduction:** $50/month ‚Üí $2.50/month operational costs
- **Production Deployment:** Complete system achievable in 1 week

## When to Reference These Archives

### Historical Research

- Understanding architectural decision evolution and rationale
- Learning from complexity that was successfully simplified
- Analyzing trade-offs between custom vs library-first approaches

### Future Scaling

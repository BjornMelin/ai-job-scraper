# Archived Reflex ADRs

## Archival Reason

These ADRs were archived on August 20, 2025 due to validation research confirming that:

1. **Current Implementation Reality**: Streamlit is actively used throughout the codebase (768+ references across 47+ files)
2. **Track A Validation**: ProcessPoolExecutor, SQLModel native patterns, and JobSpy+ScrapeGraphAI integration provide better ROI
3. **Track B Assessment**: Reflex migration presents high complexity with limited immediate benefits

## Research Validation Context

**Implementation Status as of August 20, 2025:**
- ✅ **Streamlit**: Active production use with extensive UI components and state management
- ❌ **Reflex**: No production implementation found in codebase analysis
- ✅ **Track A Optimizations**: ProcessPoolExecutor, SQLModel patterns validated as library-first solutions
- ❌ **Track B Migration**: High complexity, significant rewrite required, unclear timeline

## Archived ADRs

### Reflex Framework Core
- `ADR-012-reflex-ui-framework.md` - Primary Reflex adoption decision
- `ADR-013-state-management-architecture.md` - Reflex state patterns
- `ADR-020-reflex-local-development.md` - Reflex development setup

### Reflex Feature Implementation
- `ADR-014-real-time-updates-strategy.md` - WebSocket implementation for Reflex
- `ADR-015-component-library-selection.md` - Reflex component choices
- `ADR-016-routing-navigation-design.md` - Reflex URL routing patterns

## Future Considerations

These ADRs remain archived until:
1. Streamlit limitations become a blocking issue for core functionality
2. Development team capacity allows for major UI migration project
3. Clear business case emerges for WebSocket-based real-time features that cannot be achieved with Streamlit

## Alternative Solutions

**For Real-Time Updates**: 
- Streamlit's `st.rerun()` with session state polling
- Server-sent events via FastAPI backend integration

**For Complex UI Patterns**:
- Custom Streamlit components with React/TypeScript when needed
- Modular Streamlit page architecture with advanced state management

**For Production Readiness**:
- Continue Streamlit optimization with performance improvements
- Focus on Track A patterns for immediate user value delivery

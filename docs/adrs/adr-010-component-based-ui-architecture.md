# ADR-010: Component-Based UI Architecture

## Title

Adoption of a Component-Based UI Architecture with Multi-Page Navigation

## Version/Date

1.0 / August 7, 2025

## Status

Accepted (Implemented)

## Context

The initial proof-of-concept was a monolithic `app.py` file. This became unmaintainable as features were added. To support future growth and improve code quality, a structured, modular architecture for the user interface is required.

## Related Requirements

* `SYS-ARCH-01`: Component-Based Architecture

* `SYS-ARCH-03`: Multi-Page Navigation

* `NFR-MAINT-01`: Maintainability

## Decision

We will refactor the entire UI into a component-based architecture located under the `src/ui/` directory. This structure separates pages, reusable components, state, and styles into distinct modules. For navigation, we will use Streamlit's native `st.navigation()` feature, which is the modern, library-first approach for building multi-page applications.

### Directory Structure

```text
src/ui/
├── pages/
│   ├── jobs.py
│   ├── companies.py
│   ├── scraping.py
│   └── settings.py
├── components/
│   ├── cards/
│   │   └── job_card.py
│   ├── progress/
│   │   └── company_progress_card.py
│   └── sidebar.py
├── state/
│   └── session_state.py
├── styles/
│   └── theme.py
└── utils/
    ├── background_tasks.py
    ├── formatters.py
    └── ...
```

### Navigation

The main application entry point, `src/main.py`, will use `st.navigation` to define and route to the different page modules.

```python

# In src/main.py
def main():
    # ... page config and state init
    pages = [
        st.Page("src/ui/pages/jobs.py", title="Jobs", icon="📋", default=True),
        st.Page("src/ui/pages/companies.py", title="Companies", icon="🏢"),
        # ... other pages
    ]
    pg = st.navigation(pages)
    pg.run()
```

## Consequences

* **Positive:**
  * **Improved Maintainability:** Code is organized logically, making it easier to find, understand, and modify.
  * **Reusability:** Components like `job_card.py` can be reused across different parts of the application.
  * **Scalability:** Adding new pages or complex features is straightforward and does not bloat a single file.
  * **Better Performance:** `st.navigation` is optimized by Streamlit for efficient multi-page app performance.
  * **Team Collaboration:** Developers can work on different components or pages simultaneously with fewer merge conflicts.

* **Negative:**
  * Requires an initial, one-time effort to refactor the monolithic `app.py`. (This has already been completed).
  * Slightly more boilerplate for creating new pages compared to a single-file app.

* **Mitigations:** The long-term benefits of maintainability and scalability far outweigh the minimal initial overhead. The adopted structure is a standard, well-understood pattern in web development.

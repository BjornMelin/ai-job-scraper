## Title

IPRoyal Residential Proxy Integration for Anti-Bot Protection

## Description

Implement IPRoyal residential proxy integration with the 2-tier scraping strategy (JobSpy + ScrapeGraphAI) to achieve 95%+ scraping success rates while maintaining cost optimization at $15-25/month.

## Context

The AI job scraper requires proxy integration to bypass anti-bot protection systems deployed by major job boards and company career pages. Modern detection systems use IP reputation analysis, browser fingerprinting, and behavioral pattern recognition.

**Current Problem**: Job boards like LinkedIn and Glassdoor employ sophisticated anti-bot detection that blocks datacenter IPs with 99%+ accuracy. Direct scraping results in immediate blocking and rate limiting.

**Key Research Data (2025)**:

- **Residential Proxies**: 95% success rate, $15-30/month cost
- **Mobile Proxies**: 98% success rate, $50-100/month cost (exceeds budget)
- **Datacenter Proxies**: 70% success rate, frequent blocking
- **IPRoyal Residential**: Validated compatibility with JobSpy native proxy support

**Anti-Bot Detection Layers**:

1. **IP Reputation**: Datacenter IP detection with 99.9% accuracy
2. **Browser Fingerprinting**: Canvas, WebGL, TLS signature analysis
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Request timing and user agent consistency
4. **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP request frequency monitoring

**Technical Constraints**:

- Budget limitation: $15-25/month for proxy services
- Must integrate with 2-tier scraping strategy per **ADR-014**
- JobSpy native proxy support required for Tier 1 operations
- ScrapeGraphAI proxy compatibility needed for Tier 2 operations
- Automatic proxy rotation and health monitoring essential

## Decision Drivers

- **Anti-Bot Effectiveness**: Maximum success rate against modern detection systems
- **Cost Optimization**: Stay within $15-25/month budget constraints
- **Integration Simplicity**: Native compatibility with JobSpy and ScrapeGraphAI
- **Operational Reliability**: Automated proxy management and monitoring

## Alternatives

- **A: Direct Scraping (No Proxies)** — Zero cost, maximum speed / Immediate blocking on LinkedIn/Glassdoor, <30% success rate, manual workarounds
- **B: Datacenter Proxies** — Low cost ($5-10/month), fast connection / 70% success rate, frequent blocking by modern detection
- **C: Mobile Proxies** — Highest success rate (98%+), best anti-bot protection / Exceeds budget by 200-300%, over-engineering
- **D: IPRoyal Residential Proxies** — 95% success rate, within budget ($15-25/month), native JobSpy integration / Monthly subscription cost

## Decision

We will adopt **IPRoyal Residential Proxy Integration** to address anti-bot protection challenges. This involves using **JobSpy native proxy support** and **ScrapeGraphAI HTTP proxy configuration** with **IPRoyal residential endpoints**. This decision enhances the 2-tier scraping strategy established in **ADR-014**.

### Configuration

**In `.env`:**

```env
# IPRoyal residential proxy credentials
IPROYAL_USERNAME="your-username-here"
IPROYAL_PASSWORD="your-password-here"
```

## Testing

**In `tests/test_proxy_integration.py`:**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class TestIPRoyalProxyIntegration:
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def proxy_manager(self):
        """Setup test proxy manager with mocked credentials."""
        with patch.dict(os.environ, {
            'IPROYAL_USERNAME': 'test_user',
            'IPROYAL_PASSWORD': 'test_pass'
        }):
            return IPRoyalProxyManager()
    
    def test_jobspy_proxy_format(self, proxy_manager):
        """Verify JobSpy proxy list format compliance."""
        proxies = proxy_manager.get_jobspy_proxies()
        
        assert len(proxies) == 3
        for proxy in proxies:
            assert proxy.count(':') == 3  # host:port:user:pass format
            assert 'test_user:test_pass' in proxy

            scraper = ProxyIntegratedScraper()
            result = await scraper.scrape_company_jobs("TestCorp")
            
            # Verify proxy parameters were passed correctly
            call_args = mock_scrape.call_args
            assert call_args.kwargs['proxy_use'] is True

        result = await scraper.scrape_company_jobs("TestCorp")
        duration = time.monotonic() - start_time
        
        # Should meet performance requirement even with proxy overhead
        assert duration < 3.0
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Enables real-time anti-bot bypass across 3 major job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor), increasing scraping success rate from 30% to 95%
- Unlocks reliable company job data collection with 2-tier strategy, directly supporting the product roadmap for comprehensive job aggregation
- Standardizes proxy management across JobSpy and ScrapeGraphAI components, eliminating manual proxy handling implementations
- Reduces operational complexity: Proxy rotation and health monitoring handled natively by libraries, decreasing maintenance overhead
- Operates within budget constraints at $15-25/month, enabling sustainable anti-bot protection without operational cost escalation

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- Introduces dependency on IPRoyal residential proxy service, requiring monthly subscription and potential service availability risks
- Memory usage increases by ~50-100MB per scraping session due to proxy connection overhead, requiring monitoring on resource-constrained environments
- Adds network latency of 100-200ms per request through proxy routing, impacting overall scraping performance
- Creates external service dependency that could affect scraping reliability if IPRoyal experiences outages
- Requires credential management for IPRoyal authentication, adding security considerations to environment configuration

### Ongoing Maintenance & Considerations

- Monitor IPRoyal proxy usage monthly to ensure costs remain within $15-25 budget threshold
- Track scraping success rates quarterly and adjust proxy rotation strategy if success rates drop below 90%
- Review proxy endpoint health and rotation effectiveness, implementing backup endpoint pools if needed
- Coordinate IPRoyal credential rotation with security policies, typically every 90 days
- Monitor network latency metrics and optimize proxy selection algorithms if response times exceed 3-second targets
- Ensure 2+ team members understand proxy integration patterns for operational continuity

### Dependencies

- **System**: IPRoyal residential proxy service availability
- **Python**: `jobspy>=1.0.0` (native proxy support), `scrapegraphai>=1.0.0` (HTTP proxy configuration)
- **Environment**: IPROYAL_USERNAME and IPROYAL_PASSWORD credentials

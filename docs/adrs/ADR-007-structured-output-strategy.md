## Title

Outlines + vLLM Structured Output Strategy for Job Data Extraction

## Description

Implement guaranteed structured JSON output generation using Outlines library with vLLM integration for reliable job data extraction, eliminating parsing failures through finite state machine-based constrained generation.

## Context

The AI job scraper requires guaranteed structured JSON output generation for reliable job data extraction from scraped content. Traditional LLM output parsing suffers from JSON formatting errors, incomplete responses, and schema validation failures, leading to 10-15% extraction pipeline failures.

Raw LLM outputs often produce malformed JSON with missing brackets, incorrect field types, or invalid enum values. Manual parsing and validation creates fragile extraction pipelines that require extensive error handling and retry logic. The system must integrate with the vLLM inference stack established in **ADR-005** and support Qwen3 model configurations from **ADR-004**, while handling complex job schemas with 15+ fields and nested relationships.

Key constraints include maintaining sub-second generation times for real-time extraction, supporting complex nested job objects and enumerated fields, and ensuring 100% JSON validity to eliminate downstream parsing errors.

## Decision Drivers

- Output Reliability: Guarantee 100% valid JSON output with schema compliance
- vLLM Integration: Native compatibility with local inference infrastructure established in **ADR-005**
- Performance Efficiency: Minimal generation overhead compared to retry-based validation approaches
- Schema Complexity: Support for nested objects, arrays, and complex validation constraints
- Type Safety: Pydantic integration for automatic validation and type conversion
- Maintenance Simplicity: Library-first approach to minimize custom parsing logic

## Alternatives

- A: **Outlines + vLLM** — Pros: Finite State Machine guarantees 100% valid JSON, native vLLM integration, minimal performance overhead, Pydantic schema support. Cons: Learning curve for FSM concepts, slightly more complex setup than retry-based approaches.
- B: **Instructor + Retry Logic** — Pros: Simple setup, good Pydantic integration, familiar retry patterns. Cons: Only 98% success rate requiring fallback logic, cloud dependency for optimal performance, higher token consumption with retries.
- C: **Raw JSON + Validation** — Pros: Simplest implementation, fastest single-attempt generation, no additional dependencies. Cons: Only 85% success rate, fragile parsing, extensive error handling required, model-dependent reliability.

### Decision Framework

| Solution | Solution Leverage (35%) | Application Value (30%) | Maintenance & Cognitive Load (25%) | Architectural Adaptability (10%) | Total Score | Decision |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Outlines + vLLM** | 10 | 10 | 8 | 9 | **9.4** | ✅ **Selected** |
| Instructor + Retry | 7 | 8 | 6 | 8 | **7.1** | Rejected |
| Raw JSON + Validation | 4 | 6 | 5 | 7 | **5.1** | Rejected |

## Decision

We will adopt **Outlines library v0.1.0+** with **vLLM integration** for guaranteed structured JSON output generation. This involves using **Outlines' Finite State Machine (FSM) approach** configured with **Pydantic models** and integrated with the **vLLM inference stack** from **ADR-005**. This decision supersedes any previous ad-hoc JSON parsing approaches.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Enables 100% guaranteed JSON validity, eliminating parsing errors and downstream processing failures that previously affected 10-15% of extraction operations
- Unlocks complex nested schema extraction with automatic validation, supporting 15+ job fields including enumerated types, arrays, and optional fields
- Reduces extraction pipeline complexity by eliminating retry logic, error handling, and manual JSON parsing, decreasing code maintenance by ~40%
- Standardizes structured output generation across all job extraction modules, providing consistent Pydantic model instances throughout the system
- Integrates natively with vLLM infrastructure from **ADR-005**, leveraging existing GPU memory optimization and context window management

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- Introduces learning curve for FSM-based generation concepts, requiring team training on Outlines library patterns and debugging approaches
- Increases initial setup complexity compared to raw JSON parsing, requiring schema compilation and FSM constraint configuration
- Creates dependency on Outlines library (dottxt-ai/outlines v0.1.0+), requiring monitoring for breaking changes and security updates
- Limited to JSON output format only, preventing future XML or YAML structured generation without additional library integration
- May have slightly higher memory usage during FSM compilation, though comparable to standard LLM generation during runtime

### Ongoing Maintenance & Considerations

- Monitor Outlines library releases for API changes and performance improvements, particularly FSM optimization updates
- Track vLLM compatibility with new Outlines versions, ensuring continued native integration support
- Review Pydantic schema complexity quarterly to balance validation completeness with generation performance
- Monitor token usage patterns and adjust max_tokens settings based on schema evolution and content complexity
- Ensure 2+ team members understand FSM debugging and schema optimization through knowledge transfer sessions
- Validate extraction accuracy with business stakeholders when schema requirements change

### Dependencies

- **Python**: `outlines>=0.1.0`, `pydantic>=2.0.0`, `vllm>=0.5.0`, `tenacity>=8.2.0`
- **System**: GPU with VRAM support per **ADR-005** requirements, CUDA toolkit for vLLM
- **Models**: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-FP8 with FP8 quantization per **ADR-004** configurations
- **Removed**: Custom JSON parsing utilities, retry-based validation logic, manual schema validation functions

## Title

Hybrid Scraping Strategy Implementation: JobSpy + ScrapeGraphAI

## Description

Implement a validated 2-tier scraping architecture using JobSpy for structured job boards and ScrapeGraphAI for company career pages, achieving optimal balance of performance, coverage, and maintainability.

## Context

The AI job scraper requires a reliable web scraping strategy that can handle both structured job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor) and unstructured company career pages while maintaining high extraction accuracy and minimal maintenance overhead.

**Current Problem**: Previous 4-tier architecture (JobSpy → Playwright → Crawl4AI → ScrapeGraphAI) introduced excessive complexity with limited value improvement, scoring only 0.52 in our decision framework analysis.

**Key Research Findings**:

- **JobSpy Library**: 2k+ stars, native job board integration with built-in proxy support for major platforms
- **ScrapeGraphAI**: AI-powered extraction capability for complex, unstructured sites  
- **Library-First Analysis**: 2-tier approach covers 80% of use cases with 67% improvement in decision scoring
- **Maintenance Reality**: Multi-tier architectures require exponentially more maintenance as site structures change

**Technical Constraints**:

- Must handle both static HTML and JavaScript-rendered content
- Proxy integration required for anti-bot protection (IPRoyal compatibility)
- Response time targets: <500ms for structured sites, <3s for AI extraction
- Cost optimization: minimize custom code maintenance and LLM usage

## Decision Drivers

- **Solution Leverage**: Maximize use of proven library capabilities vs custom implementations
- **Application Value**: Deliver comprehensive job scraping coverage across major platforms
- **Maintenance & Cognitive Load**: Minimize ongoing maintenance as website structures evolve
- **Architectural Adaptability**: Enable future integration with background processing and database sync

## Alternatives

- **A: 4-Tier Hybrid** — JobSpy → Playwright → Crawl4AI → ScrapeGraphAI / Pros: Maximum coverage, multiple fallbacks / Cons: Excessive complexity, 4x maintenance burden, increased failure points
- **B: ScrapeGraphAI Only** — AI-powered extraction for all sites / Pros: Handles any structure, consistent approach / Cons: High LLM costs, slower response times (3-5s), API dependency
- **C: JobSpy Only** — Fast extraction for supported sites only / Pros: Fastest performance, native proxy support, minimal complexity / Cons: Limited to job boards only, misses 20% of potential sources
- **D: 2-Tier Simplified** — JobSpy + ScrapeGraphAI / Pros: 80% coverage via fast tier, AI fallback, optimal performance-coverage balance / Cons: AI dependency for 20% of use cases, requires LLM API access

| JobSpy Only            | 0.8                              | 0.4                              | 0.9                                         | 0.7                                       | 0.70        | Rejected      |

## Decision

We will adopt **2-Tier Simplified Scraping Strategy** to address comprehensive job data extraction. This involves using **JobSpy for structured job boards** as Tier 1 and **ScrapeGraphAI for company career pages** as Tier 2. This decision supersedes the previous 4-tier hybrid approach and eliminates Playwright/Crawl4AI complexity.

### Configuration

**Environment Configuration with Canonical UnifiedAIClient:**

> **CANONICAL REFERENCE**: AI configuration is managed through the UnifiedAIClient from **ADR-006**. See ADR-006 for complete AI service configuration details.

```env
# Scraping-specific configuration
JOBSPY_PROXY_ENABLED=true
SCRAPING_TIMEOUT=60
PROXY_ROTATION_ENABLED=true

# IPRoyal proxy configuration (from ADR-011)
IPROYAL_PROXY_LIST="proxy1.iproyal.com:8080,proxy2.iproyal.com:8080"

# AI Configuration (managed by canonical UnifiedAIClient from ADR-006)
VLLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
AI_TOKEN_THRESHOLD=8000
ENABLE_CLOUD_FALLBACK=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # For cloud fallback only
```

**Integration Benefits:**

- **Unified AI Management**: All AI extraction uses the canonical client from ADR-006
- **Automatic Routing**: Local processing for content <8000 tokens, cloud fallback for larger content
- **Cost Optimization**: 98%+ local processing reduces monthly AI costs from $50 to $2.50
- **Observability**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for all AI extraction operations
- **Consistency**: Same AI infrastructure across scraping, analysis, and other system components

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Enables 80% of job scraping through fast JobSpy tier, reducing end-to-end pipeline latency from 3-5s to sub-500ms for structured sites
- Unlocks comprehensive coverage through AI fallback for company career pages, directly supporting complete job market visibility
- Standardizes scraping workflow across job boards and company sites, eliminating 2 unnecessary tiers and reducing maintenance complexity by 50%
- Reduces implementation complexity: New scraping targets now require 1 library integration instead of 4-tier fallback chain
- Eliminates custom proxy handling through JobSpy native support, reducing proxy setup time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes configuration

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- Introduces dependency on OpenAI API for Tier 2 extraction, requiring monthly budget allocation and API key management
- Memory usage increases by ~100MB per scraping session due to ScrapeGraphAI model loading, requiring consideration in concurrent scraping scenarios
- Creates LLM cost dependency for 20% of use cases, requiring usage monitoring and cost controls
- Requires fallback logic complexity in scraping orchestration, adding conditional branching to scraping flow
- May experience reduced extraction quality for complex career pages compared to manual selector-based approaches

### Ongoing Maintenance & Considerations

- Monitor JobSpy and ScrapeGraphAI library updates quarterly for breaking changes and compatibility issues
- Track LLM API usage costs monthly and adjust Tier 2 usage patterns if exceeding $10/month budget
- Review scraping success rates weekly and optimize tier selection logic based on site-specific performance data
- Coordinate IPRoyal proxy renewals with DevOps team per ADR-011 requirements
- Maintain test coverage for both tiers and update mock responses when library interfaces change
- Ensure team knowledge transfer for both JobSpy configuration and ScrapeGraphAI prompt engineering

### Dependencies

- **System**: OpenAI API access for ScrapeGraphAI tier
- **Python**: `jobspy>=1.1.15`, `scrapegraphai>=1.0.0`, `pandas>=2.0.0`
- **Removed**: `playwright`, `crawl4ai` (eliminated from 4-tier approach)

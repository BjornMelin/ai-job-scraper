## Metadata

**Status:** Accepted
**Version/Date:** v2.1 / 2025-08-22

## Title

Simple vLLM Inference Stack with Native Features

## Description

Use vLLM with minimal FP8 configuration, leveraging native features for all memory management, optimization, and hardware handling. Implements library-first approach by utilizing vLLM's built-in FP8 quantization capabilities on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU.

## Context

The initial v1.0 inference stack suffered from over-engineering with extensive custom implementations that duplicated vLLM's native capabilities. Analysis revealed 570+ lines of custom code reimplementing features that vLLM handles natively with superior reliability and performance.

### Previous Over-Engineering Problems

- Extensive environment variable configuration (150+ lines)
- Custom memory management and monitoring systems
- Complex quantization and optimization settings
- Manual hardware tuning and performance optimization
- Reinvention of vLLM's built-in capabilities

### Library-First Reality Discovery

vLLM's native features eliminate the need for custom implementations:

- `swap_space=4` provides automatic CPU offload and memory management
- `gpu_memory_utilization=0.9` optimizes VRAM automatically for RTX 4090 Laptop GPU with FP8
- Native Flash Attention 2 support for Ada Lovelace architecture
- Built-in FP8 quantization for 8x memory reduction on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (CC 8.9)
- Production-tested reliability with extensive user base

The RTX 4090 Laptop GPU's 16GB VRAM with Ada Lovelace architecture is optimally supported by vLLM's automatic hardware detection and Flash Attention 2 implementation.

## Decision Drivers

- Eliminate 570+ lines of custom memory management complexity
- Reduce configuration overhead from 150+ lines to 15 lines
- Utilize production-tested vLLM optimizations over untested custom code
- Minimize time to deployment from weeks to hours
- Improve system reliability through library delegation
- Leverage RTX 4090 Laptop GPU hardware capabilities through native optimization

## Alternatives

- A: Keep Complex v1.0 Configuration — Pros: Maximum theoretical control / Cons: Complex setup, reimplements vLLM features, maintenance burden
- B: Custom Inference Engine — Pros: Complete control / Cons: Months of development, reinventing the wheel, untested reliability
- C: Simple vLLM with Defaults — Pros: Works out of the box, production-tested, minimal config, automatic optimization / Cons: Less fine-grained manual control

### Decision Framework

| Option | Solution Leverage (35%) | Application Value (30%) | Maintenance & Cognitive Load (25%) | Architectural Adaptability (10%) | Total Score | Decision |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Simple vLLM with Defaults** | 9.0 | 8.5 | 9.5 | 8.0 | **8.85** | ✅ **Selected** |
| Keep Complex v1.0 | 3.0 | 7.0 | 2.0 | 6.0 | 4.15 | Rejected |
| Custom Inference Engine | 1.0 | 9.0 | 1.0 | 7.0 | 3.95 | Rejected |

## Decision

We will adopt **Simple vLLM Configuration with FP8 Quantization** to address inference stack complexity. This involves using **vLLM v0.6.2+** configured with **quantization="fp8"**, **swap_space=4** and **gpu_memory_utilization=0.9**. This decision supersedes **ADR-005 v1.0's complex configuration approach**.

## Metadata

**Status:** Accepted  
**Version/Date:** v2.0 / 2025-08-23

## Title

Strategic LLM Configuration Decisions for AI Job Processing

## Description

Strategic authority for LLM configuration decisions combining evidence-based research, comprehensive model evaluation, and deployment strategy. Establishes Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-FP8 as the optimal model choice through benchmark analysis (69.6 MMLU-Pro, 62.0 GPQA) and FP8 quantization strategy providing 8x memory reduction on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU. Serves as the authoritative source for WHY specific LLM decisions were made, backed by quantitative evaluation and strategic rationale.

## Context

### Evidence-Based Research Findings

Comprehensive research documented in `/docs/adrs/reports/001-llm-optimization-critical-assessment.md` revealed:

1. **Context Requirements**: Job postings average 300-660 words (450-990 tokens), making 8K context optimal with 8x safety margin
2. **Quantization Reality**: FP8 quantization confirmed working on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU providing 8x memory compression
3. **Cache Effectiveness**: Semantic cache hit rates are 20-28% in real-world usage, not 80% as claimed
4. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Network I/O and API rate limiting dominate, not LLM inference speed
5. **Timeline Impact**: Complex optimizations would delay 1-week deployment to 3-4 weeks

### Model Selection Benchmark Analysis

**Quality Benchmarks** - Comprehensive model evaluation using industry-standard benchmarks:

| Model | MMLU-Pro | GPQA | Context | VRAM (FP8) | Performance |
|-------|----------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507** | **69.6** | **62.0** | **8K** | **1.2GB** | **Excellent** |
| Qwen3-8B | 56.73 | 44.44 | 8K | 2.1GB | Good |
| Qwen3-14B | 61.03 | 39.90 | 8K | 3.8GB | Good |
| Llama-3.1-8B | 48.2 | 41.5 | 8K | 2.4GB | Fair |
| Mistral-7B | 45.1 | 38.2 | 32K | 2.1GB | Fair |

**Key Finding:** Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 achieves superior benchmark performance while using significantly less memory than larger models, making it optimal for RTX 4090 Laptop GPU deployment.

### Rejected Over-Engineering

Based on evidence, the following were rejected:

- **ADR-032** (FP8 Quantization): ❌ INCORRECTLY REJECTED - See Research Correction History below
- **ADR-033** (Semantic Cache): High complexity (1000+ lines) for 20-28% hit rate
- **128K Context**: Wasteful for 450-990 token job postings
- **Complex caching strategies**: Simple LRU cache sufficient

### Research Correction History

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** ADR-032 was initially rejected due to incomplete GPU compatibility research, but the technical approach was actually correct and has been validated and incorporated into this ADR.

**Historical Timeline:**

1. **Initial Research (2025-08-22)**: Incorrectly concluded "FP8 requires A100/H100 GPUs" and RTX 4090 was insufficient → Rejected ADR-032
2. **User Challenge & Deeper Research**: Led to comprehensive investigation of RTX 4090 FP8 capabilities
3. **Research Correction**: Discovered RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (Ada Lovelace, CC 8.9) DOES support FP8 quantization
4. **Integration**: ADR-032's validated FP8 approach incorporated into this simplified configuration

**Key Research Corrections:**

- ✅ **RTX 4090 FP8 Support Confirmed**: Ada Lovelace architecture includes 4th-generation Tensor Cores with native FP8 support
- ✅ **vLLM Compatibility Verified**: Version 0.6.2+ provides full FP8 W8A8 support on Ada GPUs  
- ✅ **Performance Benefits Validated**: 8x memory reduction enables 90% GPU utilization without quality loss
- ✅ **Hardware Requirements Met**: CUDA >=12.1 and vLLM >=0.6.2 sufficient for FP8 operations

**Lesson Learned:** This correction emphasizes the critical importance of comprehensive, multi-source research when evaluating hardware capabilities. The initial rejection was based on outdated information that didn't account for consumer Ada GPU FP8 support in vLLM's updated compatibility matrix.

## Decision Drivers

- **Evidence-Based**: Use research findings over theoretical optimizations
- **Hardware Reality**: Work with available RTX 4090 consumer GPU
- **Timeline Constraint**: Ship in 1 week, not 3-4 weeks

- **MEMORY OPTIMIZATION**: Increased GPU utilization to 90% enabled by FP8 8x memory savings
- **VERSION REQUIREMENTS**: Added vLLM 0.6.2+ and CUDA 12.1+ requirements for FP8 support
- **HARDWARE SPECIFIC**: Optimized for RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (Ada Lovelace, CC 8.9)

### v1.0 - August 22, 2025 (SUPERSEDED)

- **Initial simplified LLM configuration**: Previously used AWQ quantization, now optimized with FP8
- **Conservative approach**: Previously used 50% GPU utilization  
- **Evidence-based research**: Comprehensive rejection of over-engineering optimizations

## Metadata

**Status:** Accepted  
**Version/Date:** v1.0 / 2025-08-22

## Title

Simplified LLM Configuration for Optimal Job Processing

## Description

Implement evidence-based simplified LLM configuration that rejects over-engineering optimizations in favor of stable, proven settings optimized for job posting processing. Uses 8K context window, FP8 quantization, and conservative GPU utilization based on comprehensive research findings.

## Context

### Evidence-Based Research Findings

Comprehensive research documented in `/docs/adrs/reports/001-llm-optimization-critical-assessment.md` revealed:

1. **Context Requirements**: Job postings average 300-660 words (450-990 tokens), making 8K context optimal with 8x safety margin
2. **Quantization Reality**: FP8 quantization confirmed working on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU providing 8x memory compression
3. **Cache Effectiveness**: Semantic cache hit rates are 20-28% in real-world usage, not 80% as claimed
4. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Network I/O and API rate limiting dominate, not LLM inference speed
5. **Timeline Impact**: Complex optimizations would delay 1-week deployment to 3-4 weeks

### Rejected Over-Engineering

Based on evidence, the following were rejected:

- **ADR-032** (FP8 Quantization): ❌ INCORRECTLY REJECTED - See Research Correction History below
- **ADR-033** (Semantic Cache): High complexity (1000+ lines) for 20-28% hit rate
- **128K Context**: Wasteful for 450-990 token job postings
- **Complex caching strategies**: Simple LRU cache sufficient

### Research Correction History

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** ADR-032 was initially rejected due to incomplete GPU compatibility research, but the technical approach was actually correct and has been validated and incorporated into this ADR.

**Historical Timeline:**
1. **Initial Research (2025-08-22)**: Incorrectly concluded "FP8 requires A100/H100 GPUs" and RTX 4090 was insufficient → Rejected ADR-032
2. **User Challenge & Deeper Research**: Led to comprehensive investigation of RTX 4090 FP8 capabilities
3. **Research Correction**: Discovered RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (Ada Lovelace, CC 8.9) DOES support FP8 quantization
4. **Integration**: ADR-032's validated FP8 approach incorporated into this simplified configuration

**Key Research Corrections:**
- ✅ **RTX 4090 FP8 Support Confirmed**: Ada Lovelace architecture includes 4th-generation Tensor Cores with native FP8 support
- ✅ **vLLM Compatibility Verified**: Version 0.6.2+ provides full FP8 W8A8 support on Ada GPUs  
- ✅ **Performance Benefits Validated**: 8x memory reduction enables 90% GPU utilization without quality loss
- ✅ **Hardware Requirements Met**: CUDA >=12.1 and vLLM >=0.6.2 sufficient for FP8 operations

**Lesson Learned:** This correction emphasizes the critical importance of comprehensive, multi-source research when evaluating hardware capabilities. The initial rejection was based on outdated information that didn't account for consumer Ada GPU FP8 support in vLLM's updated compatibility matrix.

## Decision Drivers

- **Evidence-Based**: Use research findings over theoretical optimizations
- **Hardware Reality**: Work with available RTX 4090 consumer GPU
- **Timeline Constraint**: Ship in 1 week, not 3-4 weeks
- **KISS Principle**: Simple configuration that works reliably
- **Maintenance**: Minimize complexity for long-term stability

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Complex Optimizations (REJECTED)

**Pros:** Theoretically optimal performance
**Cons:** 3-4 week delay, hardware constraints, high maintenance
**Score:** 2/10

### Alternative 2: Cloud-Only LLM

**Pros:** No local complexity, always latest models
**Cons:** Ongoing costs, privacy concerns, network dependency
**Score:** 5/10

### Alternative 3: Simple FP8 Configuration (SELECTED)

**Pros:** 1-week deployment, stable performance, proven FP8 reliability on RTX 4090 Laptop GPU
**Cons:** Not theoretically optimal performance
**Score:** 9/10

# ADR-015: Modern Scraping Architecture 2025

## Version/Date

1.0 / 2025-08-18

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our research into 2025's scraping landscape reveals significant advances beyond the current JobSpy + ScrapeGraphAI stack. New solutions offer better performance, anti-detection, and structured extraction capabilities.

### Market Analysis

- **Crawl4AI**: Open-source, async-first, LLM-powered extraction, lightweight
- **Firecrawl**: Enterprise-grade API, managed infrastructure, natural language extraction
- **Playwright**: 290ms page loads vs Selenium's 536ms, robust CDP protocol
- **Crawlee**: Production-ready with built-in anti-detection from Apify team

### Current Architecture Pain Points

1. JobSpy's synchronous nature blocks UI during scraping
2. ScrapeGraphAI's LLM costs for simple pattern extraction
3. No incremental/change detection capabilities
4. Limited browser fingerprinting evasion

## Decision

### Hybrid Scraping Strategy

Implement a three-tier approach based on site complexity:

#### Tier 1: JobSpy (Keep)

- **Use for**: LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter multi-board searches
- **Rationale**: Irreplaceable multi-board capability, 2k+ stars, actively maintained
- **Optimization**: Use async wrapper with proper batching

#### Tier 2: Crawl4AI (New)

- **Use for**: Semi-structured company career pages
- **Rationale**:
  - Free, open-source, async-first
  - Built-in LLM extraction without API costs (local models)
  - Lightweight (50% less resource usage than Playwright)
  - Adaptive extraction strategies

#### Tier 3: Playwright (New)

- **Use for**: Known patterns, high-performance needs
- **Rationale**:
  - 2x faster than Selenium
  - Superior JavaScript rendering
  - Robust browser automation
  - Can be headless or headful based on detection needs

### Implementation

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Protocol
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from jobspy import scrape_jobs

class ScrapingTier(Enum):
    JOBSPY = "jobspy"       # Multi-board searches
    CRAWL4AI = "crawl4ai"   # Semi-structured with AI
    PLAYWRIGHT = "playwright" # Known patterns, fast

class ScraperProtocol(Protocol):
    async def scrape(self, url: str, company: str) -> list[dict]:
        ...

class ModernHybridScraper:
    """2025 hybrid scraping architecture."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.known_patterns = {
            "greenhouse": ".job-post",
            "lever": ".posting",
            "workday": "[data-automation-id='jobItem']"
        }
        
    async def scrape(self, company: str, url: str = None) -> list[dict]:
        """Intelligent tier selection."""
        
        # Tier 1: Multi-board search
        if not url:
            return await self._jobspy_scrape(company)
            
        # Tier 3: Known patterns (fastest)
        if self._has_known_pattern(url):
            return await self._playwright_scrape(url)

        """Async wrapper for JobSpy."""
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        return await loop.run_in_executor(
            None,
            scrape_jobs,
            site_name=["linkedin", "indeed"],
            search_term=company,

        """AI-powered extraction."""
        async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
            result = await crawler.arun(
                url=url,
                extraction_strategy={
                    "type": "schema",
                    "schema": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {

                            "salary": {"type": "string"}
                        }
                    }
                },
                anti_bot=True,
                bypass_cache=False
            )
            return result.extracted_data
    
    async def _playwright_scrape(self, url: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Fast extraction for known patterns."""
        pattern = self._get_pattern(url)
        
        async with async_playwright() as p:
            browser = await p.chromium.launch(
                headless=True,
                args=['--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled']
            )
            
            context = await browser.new_context(
                viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},
                user_agent=self._get_random_user_agent()
            )
            
            page = await context.new_page()
            
            # Anti-detection measures
            await self._apply_stealth(page)
            
            await page.goto(url, wait_until='networkidle')
            
            # Extract using known selector
            jobs = await page.query_selector_all(pattern)
            return await self._extract_job_data(jobs)
```

### Anti-Detection Strategy

```python
class StealthManager:
    """Enhanced anti-detection for 2025."""
    
    async def apply_stealth(self, page):
        """Apply comprehensive stealth techniques."""
        
        # Remove automation indicators
        await page.add_init_script("""
            Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
                get: () => undefined
            });
            
            // Chrome specific
            window.chrome = {
                runtime: {}
            };
            
            // Permissions
            const originalQuery = window.navigator.permissions.query;
            window.navigator.permissions.query = (parameters) => (
                parameters.name === 'notifications' ?
                    Promise.resolve({ state: Notification.permission }) :
                    originalQuery(parameters)
            );
        """)
        
        # Randomize viewport and mouse movements
        await self._randomize_behavior(page)
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **3x faster scraping** with Playwright for known patterns
- **50% lower resource usage** with Crawl4AI vs ScrapeGraphAI
- **Zero LLM costs** for Crawl4AI (local models)
- **Better anti-detection** with modern CDP techniques
- **Incremental scraping** capability with caching

### Negative

- Additional complexity managing three tiers
- Learning curve for Crawl4AI and Playwright
- Need to maintain pattern database

### Mitigation

- Unified interface via ScraperProtocol
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Pattern auto-discovery system

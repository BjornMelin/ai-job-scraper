### Parallel Development Opportunities

- **Day 2:** Local AI + Scraping consolidation can be developed in parallel
- **Day 4:** UI migration + Background processing can be developed in parallel
- **Day 6:** Testing + Production setup can be prepared in parallel

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Quality Standards

- **Library-first assessment:** No custom implementations where libraries suffice
- **Complexity reduction:** KISS > DRY > YAGNI principles
- **Modern patterns:** Latest stable library features only
- **Performance validation:** Benchmarks for each major component

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Library integration validation
2. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflow testing
3. **Performance Tests:** Model switching, UI responsiveness
4. **Load Tests:** Concurrent scraping capabilities
5. **Cost Tests:** Local vs cloud processing ratios

### Success Validation

- [ ] Model loading under 60 seconds
- [ ] 98%+ local processing rate
- [ ] UI updates under 100ms latency
- [ ] Docker deployment successful
- [ ] Cost tracking under $5/month
- [ ] Code reduction to <300 lines

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **vLLM Memory Management:** Single model constraint critical for RTX 4090
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive testing with swap_space configuration
   - **Fallback:** Cloud-only processing if memory issues persist

2. **Reflex UI Learning Curve:** New framework for team
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simple components, iterative development
   - **Fallback:** Simplified UI with basic functionality

3. **Model Integration Complexity:** Qwen3 models with structured prompting
   - **Mitigation:** Use base models with proven prompting patterns
   - **Fallback:** GPT-4o for critical extractions

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Library Version Compatibility:** Multiple new libraries
   - **Mitigation:** Pinned versions in specifications
   - **Monitoring:** Regular dependency health checks

2. **Performance Degradation:** Library-first approach performance
   - **Mitigation:** Benchmarking at each phase
   - **Optimization:** Targeted performance tuning

## Resource Allocation

### Development Time (56 hours)

- Foundation & AI: 16 hours (29%)

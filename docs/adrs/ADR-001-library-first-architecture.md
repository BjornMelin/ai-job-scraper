## Title

Library-First Architecture for AI Job Scraper

## Description

Establish a radical library-first architecture that leverages modern library capabilities to eliminate custom implementations and reduce codebase complexity by 89% (from 2,470 lines to 260 lines of specification).

## Context

### Critical Over-Engineering Discovered

Analysis revealed massive over-engineering across the system:

1. **570+ lines reimplementing vLLM's built-in features** (referenced in archived ADRs)
2. **700+ lines of error handling when libraries provide this natively**  
3. **UI migration proposals** (archived - current UI framework validated as optimal)
4. **Complex task orchestration when RQ handles this natively**
5. **Multi-tier scraping when Crawl4AI can handle 90% of use cases alone**

### Library Capabilities Being Ignored

**vLLM Native Features:**

- `swap_space=4` - Automatic CPU offload and memory management
- `gpu_memory_utilization=0.85` - Intelligent VRAM management
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Automatic batch optimization

**Modern UI Framework Features:**

- WebSocket support via `yield` in event handlers
- Real-time updates automatically
- Background tasks with async handlers
- Mobile responsive with modern CSS

**Tenacity Library:**

- Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Exception-specific handling

## Decision Drivers

- Eliminate custom implementations where proven libraries exist
- Reduce development time from 4+ weeks to 1 week deployment
- Achieve 89% codebase reduction through library utilization
- Minimize maintenance overhead through library delegation
- Leverage battle-tested, production-proven solutions
- Enable rapid prototyping and iteration cycles

## Related Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: Local AI inference with automatic model management
- FR-002: Real-time UI updates during scraping operations
- FR-003: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- FR-004: Web scraping with anti-bot detection capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-001: Deploy within 1 week (not 4+ weeks)
- NFR-002: Zero/near-zero maintenance architecture
- NFR-003: Library-first implementation (no custom code where libraries suffice)
- NFR-004: KISS, DRY, YAGNI adherence

### Performance Requirements

- PR-001: Model switching under 60 seconds
- PR-002: UI response times under 100ms
- PR-003: Memory usage within RTX 4090 constraints (16GB)
- PR-004: 95%+ uptime with graceful error recovery

### Integration Requirements

- IR-001: Seamless integration between vLLM, Reflex, and Crawl4AI
- IR-002: Unified configuration management
- IR-003: Single deployment pipeline
- IR-004: Shared logging and monitoring

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Continue Custom Implementation

**Pros:** Complete control over features
**Cons:** 2,470+ lines, 4+ weeks development, high maintenance
**Score:** 2/10

### Alternative 2: Partial Library Adoption

**Pros:** Gradual migration, lower risk
**Cons:** Still complex, mixed patterns, technical debt
**Score:** 5/10

### Alternative 3: Full Library-First Architecture (SELECTED)

**Pros:** 89% code reduction, 1-week shipping, battle-tested libraries
**Cons:** Less control, library dependency
**Score:** 9/10

## Decision Framework

| Criteria | Weight | Custom | Partial | Library-First |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Time to Deploy | 35% | 2 | 6 | 10 |
| Maintainability | 30% | 2 | 5 | 9 |
| Reliability | 25% | 4 | 6 | 9 |
| Feature Control | 10% | 10 | 7 | 6 |
| **Weighted Score** | **100%** | **3.1** | **5.8** | **8.95** |

## Decision

**Adopt Full Library-First Architecture** using native library features for all major components:

1. **Model Management:** vLLM with `swap_space=4` replaces 570 lines of custom code
2. **Error Handling:** Tenacity library replaces 700 lines of custom abstractions
3. **UI Framework:** Keep Reflex (no NiceGUI migration needed)
4. **Scraping:** Crawl4AI primary with JobSpy fallback
5. **Task Management:** Pure RQ with native retry capabilities

```

### Implementation Details

**Model Management (15 lines vs 570):**

```python
from vllm import LLM

class SimpleModelManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_model = None
    
    def switch_model(self, model_name: str):
        if self.current_model:
            del self.current_model
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        
        # vLLM handles all memory management
        self.current_model = LLM(
            model=model_name,
            swap_space=4,  # Automatic CPU offload
            gpu_memory_utilization=0.85  # Intelligent VRAM use
        )
```

**Error Handling (30 lines vs 700):**

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
def inference_with_fallback(prompt: str):
    try:
        return local_llm.generate(prompt)
    except Exception:
        return cloud_api.generate(prompt)  # Simple fallback
```

**Real-time UI (10 lines vs 200+ NiceGUI migration):**

```python
class State(rx.State):
    jobs: list = []
    
    async def update_jobs(self, new_job):
        self.jobs.append(new_job)
        yield  # Automatic WebSocket update!
```

**Scraping (20 lines vs 400):**

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def scrape_jobs(url: str):
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=url,
            extraction_strategy="llm",  # AI extraction built-in
            anti_bot=True,  # Anti-detection built-in
            bypass_cache=False  # Smart caching built-in
        )
        return result.extracted_data
```

### Configuration

**Single Configuration File (config.yaml):**

```yaml
# Library-first configuration - mostly defaults
models:
  primary: "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
  fallback: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"

vllm:
  swap_space: 4
  gpu_memory_utilization: 0.85
  
scraping:
  primary: "crawl4ai"  # 90% of cases
  fallback: "jobspy"   # Job boards only
  
retries:
  max_attempts: 3
  backoff_multiplier: 2
```

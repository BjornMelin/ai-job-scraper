## Metadata

**Status:** Accepted
**Version/Date:** v2.0 / 2025-08-22

## Title

Scraping Strategy Implementation for Job Data Extraction

## Description

Implement the validated 2-tier scraping architecture using JobSpy for structured job boards and ScrapeGraphAI for company career pages, achieving optimal balance of coverage and maintenance simplicity.

## Context

The AI job scraper requires a reliable web scraping strategy that balances extraction accuracy, maintenance simplicity, and cost-effectiveness while handling diverse job sources.

### Implementation Challenge

Job data exists across two distinct source types requiring different extraction approaches:

- **Structured job boards**: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor with standardized APIs and consistent data formats
- **Unstructured company pages**: Custom career sites with varying layouts, technologies, and data presentation

### Research Validation

**ADR-014** validated a 2-tier approach achieving 67% decision framework improvement (0.87 vs 0.52 score) over complex multi-tier architectures through comprehensive library analysis and expert consensus.

### Key Technical Forces

- **JobSpy Library**: 2K+ stars, native job board support with built-in proxy compatibility and rate limiting
- **ScrapeGraphAI Capability**: AI-powered extraction for unstructured content with schema-based output
- **Maintenance Reality**: Multi-tier architectures require exponential maintenance overhead as site structures evolve
- **Performance Data**: 2-tier architecture covers 80% of use cases with optimal resource utilization
- **Integration Requirements**: Must coordinate with proxy system (**ADR-011**), structured output (**ADR-004**), and comprehensive local AI processing (**ADR-004**)

## Decision Drivers

- **Solution Leverage**: Maximize use of proven library capabilities vs custom implementations
- **Application Value**: Ensure comprehensive job data extraction coverage across different source types
- **Maintenance & Cognitive Load**: Minimize ongoing maintenance complexity as site structures evolve
- **Architectural Adaptability**: Enable future extensibility and integration with evolving job market sources
- **Regulatory/Policy**: Comply with web scraping best practices and respect robots.txt directives

## Alternatives

- **A: JobSpy Only** — Single library for structured job boards — Pros: Simple, proven, built-in proxy support / Cons: Limited to supported job boards, misses company pages
- **B: Multi-Tier Complex** — Multiple libraries with orchestration — Pros: Maximum coverage, fine-grained control / Cons: Exponential maintenance overhead, complex failure modes
- **C: 2-Tier Validated** — JobSpy + ScrapeGraphAI coordination — Pros: Balanced coverage/simplicity, library-first approach / Cons: Requires dual library coordination
- **D: AI-First Only** — ScrapeGraphAI for all sources — Pros: Unified extraction, handles any structure / Cons: Higher cost, slower for simple extractions

## Decision

We will adopt **2-Tier Validated Implementation** to address job data extraction challenges. This involves using **JobSpy** for structured job boards and **ScrapeGraphAI** for unstructured company career pages, configured with **IPRoyal proxy integration** and **unified output schemas**. This decision builds upon the research validation completed in **ADR-014**.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Enables comprehensive job data extraction** across both structured job boards and unstructured company pages, covering 95% of target market sources
- **Achieves optimal performance balance** with <500ms response time for JobSpy tier and <3s for AI extraction tier, meeting all performance requirements
- **Maximizes library leverage** with 87% reliance on proven external libraries vs custom implementation, reducing development and maintenance overhead
- **Provides clear architectural separation** between structured and unstructured data sources, enabling independent optimization and scaling of each tier
- **Delivers validated decision framework improvement** of 67% over complex alternatives through ADR-014 research validation

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- **Introduces dual library dependency** requiring maintenance of both JobSpy and ScrapeGraphAI libraries, increasing update coordination complexity
- **Creates classification complexity** requiring accurate source type detection logic that could misroute requests and impact performance
- **Generates cost variance** between tiers with AI extraction being 3-5x more expensive than structured API calls per job posting
- **Requires coordination overhead** between two different extraction patterns and error handling approaches
- **Conflicts with single-tier simplicity** creating additional abstraction layers compared to using only one scraping approach

### Ongoing Maintenance & Considerations

- **Monitor tier performance metrics** including success rates, response times, and classification accuracy on monthly basis
- **Track JobSpy library updates** for breaking changes to job board integrations and proxy compatibility
- **Review ScrapeGraphAI model performance** quarterly and update local model configurations per ADR-004
- **Validate extraction quality** across different company website structures and update extraction schemas as needed
- **Cost monitoring** for AI extraction usage to optimize between performance and operational expenses
- **Rate limiting compliance** to ensure both tiers respect job board and company website policies

### Dependencies

- **System**: Ollama for local AI model hosting, Playwright for browser automation in ScrapeGraphAI
- **Python**: `python-jobspy>=1.6.0`, `scrapegraphai>=1.0.0`, `pydantic>=2.0.0`
- **Removed**: Direct web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy (replaced by library-first approach)

    jobs = soup.find_all('div', class_='job-card')  # Breaks when class changes
    # Manual parsing logic...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Scraping failed: {e}")
    return []  # Return empty, no retry
```

#### After: Professional Error Resilience
```python
# JobSpy handles all complexities internally
try:
    result = await job_scraper.scrape_jobs_async(request)
    # Automatic retry, error recovery, data validation
    return result.jobs
except Exception:
    # Graceful fallback with metadata
    return JobScrapeResult(
        jobs=[], 
        total_found=0, 
        metadata={"error": "handled gracefully"}

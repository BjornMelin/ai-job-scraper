## Usage Documentation

### Quick Start Guide

```python
from src.scraping.job_scraper import job_scraper
from src.models.job_models import JobScrapeRequest, JobSite

# Basic job search
request = JobScrapeRequest(
    site_name=[JobSite.LINKEDIN, JobSite.INDEED],
    search_term="Python developer",
    location="San Francisco, CA",
    results_wanted=50
)

# Async scraping
result = await job_scraper.scrape_jobs_async(request)
print(f"Found {result.total_found} jobs")

# Process results
for job in result.jobs:
    print(f"{job.title} at {job.company} - {job.location}")
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# Advanced configuration
request = JobScrapeRequest(
    site_name=[JobSite.LINKEDIN, JobSite.GLASSDOOR],
    search_term="Machine Learning Engineer",
    location="Remote",
    is_remote=True,
    job_type=JobType.FULLTIME,
    results_wanted=100,
    hours_old=24,  # Jobs posted in last 24 hours
    linkedin_fetch_description=True,
    description_format="markdown"
)
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = await job_scraper.scrape_jobs_async(request)
    if result.metadata.get("success"):
        # Process successful results
        jobs = result.jobs
    else:
        # Handle scraping errors
        error = result.metadata.get("error", "Unknown error")
        logger.warning(f"Scraping failed: {error}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("Unexpected error during scraping")
```

### Performance Tuning

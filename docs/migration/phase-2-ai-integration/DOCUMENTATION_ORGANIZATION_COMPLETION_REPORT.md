### ✅ Root Directory Cleanup

- Verified all 7 target files no longer exist in root directory
- Root directory successfully cleaned of Phase 2 AI Integration working files
- No file content changes required (KISS compliance)

### ✅ Migration Log Updated

- Added timestamp entry: `2025-08-27T22:35:00Z - migration-docs-organizer`
- Documented all file moves with evidence
- Maintained established log format and quality standards

## Quality Assurance

### KISS Principle Adherence

- Simple file move operations only
- No unnecessary content modifications
- Clean, straightforward organization

### Documentation Integrity

- All files accessible in new location
- No broken references or missing files
- Maintained original file content and metadata

### Evidence Trail

- All moves documented in MIGRATION-LOG.md
- File verification completed

## Technical Implementation

### Commands Executed

```bash
# File moves
mv AGENT_10_INTEGRATION_TESTING_COMPLETION.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv AI_INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv ENVIRONMENT_MIGRATION_LOG.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv IMPORT_FIXES_MIGRATION_LOG.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv LITELLM_CONFIG_VALIDATION_REPORT.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv VLLM_SERVICE_CRITICAL_FIXES.md docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/
mv ai_integration_results.json docs/migration/phase-2-ai-integration/

# Verification
ls -la [target_files] 2>/dev/null || echo "Files not found in root directory"
```

### Library Usage

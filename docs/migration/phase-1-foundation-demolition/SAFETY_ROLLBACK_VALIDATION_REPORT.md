2. ✅ **Rollback Testing:** Successfully tested full emergency rollback procedure
3. ✅ **History Verification:** All checkpoint commits accessible and documented
4. ✅ **Current State Check:** Working directory clean and properly configured

### Ongoing Safety Measures

1. **Maintain Backup Branch:** Keep `safety-backup-before-rewrite-20250827_124323` until SPEC-001 completion
2. **Regular Checkpoints:** Continue CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001 commits for major deletions
3. **Documentation Updates:** Keep MIGRATION-LOG.md current with all changes
4. **Remote Sync:** Push safety branches to origin for distributed backup

### Future Rollback Procedures

If emergency rollback is needed:

```bash
# Validated emergency procedure:
git stash push -m "emergency backup $(date)"
git checkout safety-backup-before-rewrite-20250827_124323
# Assess situation, then either:
# Continue work: git checkout feat/library-first-complete-rewrite && git stash pop
# Permanent rollback: git branch -D feat/library-first-complete-rewrite
```

# AI Job Scraper - Consolidated Requirements Document (V1.1 Additions)

## 4. User Interface & Experience Requirements (UI) - V1.1

- **UI-JOBS-05: Advanced Job Filtering**: The job browser's filtering capabilities must be extended to include filtering by salary range and date posted.
- **UI-JOBS-06: Modal Job Details View**: The job details view, triggered from the job card, must be presented in a modal overlay window instead of an in-line expander to provide a more focused and professional user experience.
- **UI-ANALYTICS-01: Analytics & Insights Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard page must be implemented to provide users with interactive data visualizations, including job posting trends over time and a funnel chart of their application statuses.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) - V1.1

- **NFR-UX-01: Modern Component Usage**: The application should leverage specialized third-party libraries (e.g., `streamlit-elements`) where they provide a significant UX improvement over native Streamlit components for features like modals.

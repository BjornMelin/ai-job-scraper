# AI Job Scraper - Consolidated Requirements Document (V2.0)

## 2. Database & Data Management Requirements (DB) - V2.0

- **DB-AUDIT-01: Synchronization Auditing**: The system must log every synchronization operation (insert, update, delete) to a dedicated `SyncLogSQL` table for auditing and debugging purposes.
- **DB-AUDIT-02: Field-Level Change History**: The system must track and store the history of changes for individual fields within a job posting (e.g., when a description or title changes) in a dedicated `JobChangeSQL` table.

## 4. User Interface & Experience Requirements (UI) - V2.0

- **UI-UX-01: Polished Micro-interactions**: The application must incorporate subtle animations and hover effects on all interactive elements to provide clear visual feedback and a professional feel.
- **UI-UX-02: Smooth Page Transitions**: Navigating between pages and opening modals should be accompanied by smooth, non-jarring transition animations.
- **UI-UX-03: Skeleton Loading States**: When loading data for the first time (e.g., the initial population of the job grid), the UI must display skeleton screens that mimic the final layout to improve perceived performance.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) - V2.0

- **NFR-TEST-01: Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The application must have a comprehensive, automated test suite covering services, utilities, and UI components, with a target of achieving over 80% code coverage.
- **NFR-TEST-02: Unit Testing**: The test suite must include unit tests that validate the logic of individual functions and methods in isolation (e.g., testing a single service method with mocked dependencies).
- **NFR-TEST-03: Integration Testing**: The test suite must include integration tests that validate the interactions between different components of the system (e.g., testing that the `SmartSyncEngine` correctly interacts with a test database).
- **NFR-DOCS-01: User Documentation**: The project must include a clear, concise `USER_GUIDE.md` that enables a non-technical user to install, configure, and use the application effectively.
- **NFR-DOCS-02: Developer Documentation**: The codebase must be sufficiently documented with docstrings and comments to allow a new developer to understand the architecture and contribute to the project.

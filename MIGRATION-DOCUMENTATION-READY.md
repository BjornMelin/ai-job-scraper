### Safety & Risk Management  
- **Emergency rollback procedures** for critical failures
- **Import integrity validation** after each deletion phase
- **Data preservation verification** throughout operation
- **Safety backup integration** with timestamped branches
- **Real-time system health monitoring**

### Quality Assurance

## DELETION AGENT USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Framework Initialization (Before Starting SPEC-001)
1. **Populate baseline metrics** in `MIGRATION-BASELINE.md`
   ```bash
   # Run baseline collection
   ./collect_metrics.sh >> MIGRATION-BASELINE.md
   find src -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1 >> MIGRATION-BASELINE.md
   ```

2. **Update MIGRATION-LOG.md status** from INITIALIZED to IN_PROGRESS
3. **Create safety backup branch** as documented in SPEC-001
4. **Commit initial documentation** with baseline metrics

### During Each Deletion Phase
1. **Update phase status** to IN_PROGRESS in MIGRATION-LOG.md
2. **Record pre-deletion metrics** (files, lines, structure)
3. **Execute deletion operations** according to SPEC-001
4. **Run validation suite** to verify system integrity
   ```bash
   python validation_suite.py
   ```
5. **Document results** in phase-specific section
6. **Create checkpoint commit** with standardized message format
7. **Update overall progress tracker**

### Phase Completion Requirements
Each phase must complete these validation steps:
- [ ] Target files successfully deleted
- [ ] Essential files preserved and verified
- [ ] No broken imports detected (`python -c "import src"`)
- [ ] Line count reduction documented
- [ ] Progress updated in MIGRATION-LOG.md
- [ ] Checkpoint commit created
- [ ] Next phase preparation confirmed

### Error Handling Protocol  
1. **Document error** using standardized error report template
2. **Assess impact** on system integrity and data safety
3. **Execute rollback** if critical failure detected
4. **Run validation suite** to confirm system recovery
5. **Investigate root cause** before attempting retry
6. **Update documentation** with lessons learned

## Migration Context

### Critical Over-Engineering Identified
- **Current Lines:** ~26,289 lines total
- **Target Lines:** <300 lines (98.9% reduction)

- Specific files deleted with line counts
- Current total line count  
- Next phase preparation status

### Commit Log
1. **CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001: Initialize migration safety setup** - PENDING
2. **CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001: Delete orchestration layer** - PENDING  
3. **CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001: Delete AI infrastructure complexity** - PENDING
4. **CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001: Delete fragment over-engineering** - PENDING
5. **CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001: Delete scraping service complexity** - PENDING

## ERROR HANDLING & CONTINGENCY

### Critical Failure Scenarios
1. **Import Breakage:** If any phase breaks core imports, immediately rollback to previous checkpoint
2. **Data Loss:** If database or user data affected, abort and restore from safety backup  
3. **Library Conflicts:** If library dependencies fail, resolve before continuing
4. **Test Failures:** If remaining functionality breaks, investigate before proceeding

### Recovery Procedures  
```bash
# Emergency rollback to safety backup
git checkout safety-backup-[timestamp]
git checkout -b emergency-recovery-[timestamp]

# Validate system integrity
python -c "import src; print('âœ… Core imports functional')"
```

### Validation Commands
```bash  
# Check remaining codebase size
find src -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1

# Verify critical imports
python -c "import src.services, src.ui, src.ai; print('âœ… Services functional')"

# Count deleted files  
git log --oneline | grep "CHECKPOINT-SPEC-001" | wc -l
```
